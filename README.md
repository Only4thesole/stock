Adidas GB Stock Checker

To use, simply put in the product code for the product you wish to check in the 'config.json' file. If you are
attempting to view stock for a product that does not yet have a product page, it will not work. I have developed
the tool so it is up to you to figure out how to install it, please do not message me regarding troubleshooting issues.
This is a python file (.py) so it can be executed through the terminal window for Mac users or through the cmd prompt
for Windows users. If you are really having trouble installing it, please refer to a YouTube video on how to execute
scripts through the appropriate application. Please make sure you have the appropriate packages installed. Thanks to
everyone who re-tweeted and downloaded this script, keep your eyes pealed on my Twitter for more useful tools and
updates.
